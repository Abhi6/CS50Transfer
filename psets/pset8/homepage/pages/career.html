                <h3 id="competitions">Competitions</h3>
                <p>
                I am planning on taking part in many computer-science-related competitions.
                The two general categories would be competitive programming and capture-the-flag (CTFs) competitions.
                The competitive programming competitions would require an in-depth understanding of data structures and algorithms.
                I would also need to know a certain amount of math and pattern recognition. This is so that I recognize the question
                as well as the answer very quickly.
                I plan on learning all of this by just going through many, many practice problems as well as reading up on competitive programming.
                The websites that I may use to get better at competitive programming would be LeetCode and Codeforces (along with any other ones I find along the way).
                </p>
                <h3 id="freelancing">Freelancing</h3>
                <p>
                I do not plan on going a 9-5 for the rest of my life. I <b>can't</b>. I am trying my best to get into freelancing as early as possible.
                The best market that I am looking at right now in this moment is web development and bug bounties.
                I can make money as a freelancer through web development by making landing pages for local businesses. I can get them to pay me a
                certain price that I can benefit and that they can afford. I will also go online through <i>fiverr</i> as well as <i>freelancer</i> in
                order to get customers. However, because I do not have previous job experience, this will be tough. So, I have to make sure I am able to create
                attractive front-ends. I can hone in this skill be looking at inspirations on YouTube as well as <i>codepens</i>. 
                The second way would be through bug bounties. This is basically where I go around to companies and acquire permission to hack into their system.
                If I do find a bug in their system or a way to bypass their security, I get paid a <b>bounty</b> based on the significance of the <b>bug</b>.                
                </p>
                <h3 id="internships">Internships</h3>
                <p>
                In order to land a solid job at a top tech company, I have to have internships. My plan to land these internships strongly depends
                on the previous two points. I want to land a solid internship (may not get one this summer, so I have to hustle) at least in winter
                break of my second year (after third semester). By landing these internships, I have the opportunity to perform well, and I do perform
                well, I will get a return offer. Basically, it is a feedback loop. Getting internships gets you more internships through return offers.
                And if you have enough experience, the return offer could be an employment offer.
                </p>
                <h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>
                <p>
                If I meet all the previous requirements...scoring well in competitions, experience through freelancing and internships,
                landing a job won't be much of a problem. However, as with anything, I would need to prepare for it through practice problems.
                Luckily, there are many websites that provide a roadmap to the likely interview questions that each company asks its candidates.
                Going through those and getting comfortable with LeetCode's <b>medium</b> and <b>hard</b> problems would significantly increase
                the chances of me landing a job at a top tech company.
